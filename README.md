# Algorithm Analyser
This is our 6th Sem Engineering Project in a team of 2 titled "Algorithm Analyser". This is mainly used to analyse sorting algorithms, how they exactly work and do the desired sorting. We can see how the sorting is being done and learn more effiently. We have even added a Login Register Page so as to increase the functionality.
