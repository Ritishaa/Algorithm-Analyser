# Algorithm Analyzer
The aim of this project was to compare and evaluate the performance of different sorting
algorithms by using bar graphs as visual representations. Bar graphs are helpful to illustrate the speed and efficiency of each algorithm in sorting a
given array of data. A Token-based authentication system was also implemented to ensure the security of the
application and prevent unauthorized access by hackers without valid login credentials.
