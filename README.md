# Algorithm Analyser
This is our 6th Sem Engineering Project in a team of 2 titled "Algorithm Analyser". This is mainly used to analyse sorting algorithms, how they exactly work and do the desired sorting. We can see how the sorting is being done and learn more efficiently. We have even added a Login Register Page so as to increase the functionality. The application is also secured with Token Based Authentication.

This application is beneficial for begginers or intermediate students to learn or understand sorting algorithms efficiently.
Happy Learning!
